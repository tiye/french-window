French Window, a Goto-Anything-inspired Window Manager design
------

Code name "落地窗" in Chinse.

### Status: designing

I'd like to make a demo about managing windows like Goto Anything,
by searching and choose windows to manager you windows in workspaces.

So the real world is represented with symbols in human brains.
It is likely not to be really like how things in real word are.
They might be just a name, or a concept, or something like that.

I want to make demos on how I would like to manage windows,
based on the idea I described in https://github.com/jiyinyiyong/chuangling

By now I'm still thinking about how to make it.
Chuangling is too complecated, I want to make a easier one.
